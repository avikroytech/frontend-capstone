# Little Lemon Booking System

Made by Avik Roy

## What to do

First clone the git repository. To do this, run this command in the folder you want to clone in:

### `git clone`

Everything should be cloned and ready to run.

## Another Option

You can also download the project manually if cloning the repo takes too much time (because of the node_modules folder).

Instead, download each folder except the node modules folder.

Then run this command within the directory:

### `npm install`

This will install all of the dependencies and make the project runnable.

## Have fun!

I hope my project is easy to grade and is well developed! Thanks for grading my project!
